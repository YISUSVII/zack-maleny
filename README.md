# Saul and Maleni

This is a gift to Saul and Maleni regarding their weeding.

## Getting Started

Instructions to Saul: To update the page you need to clone the code and create a branch from `dev`, after that create a PR to `dev` and I'll review the code or write some comments if needed, if all is working well I'll approve your PR and then merge the code to develop. I will merge the code from develop to master and trigger the deploy to go live.

### Prerequisites

Nothing! Since this is not an application,  we can open it with any browser and start working.

## Deployment

The deploy is automatically triggered when I merge code to master, so the webpage will be updated.
